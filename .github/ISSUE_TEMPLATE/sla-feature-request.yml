        â€¢ **Priority-1 (Critical â€“ Needed Urgently):** This feature is business-critical and needs to be delivered as soon as possible. It may be required to meet a client deadline, fulfill a contractual obligation, or unblock a key process. Delays may directly impact delivery, operations, or commitments you've made to your own stakeholders.


        â€¢ **Priority-2 (High â€“ Needed Soon):** Important to your workflow or goals and should be prioritised in the near term. Not immediately urgent, but adds clear value and should be scheduled in the next cycle.


        â€¢ **Priority-3 (Normal â€“ Nice to Have):** Useful improvement that makes things smoother or more efficient but isnâ€™t blocking anything. Can be planned into a future update.


        â€¢ **Priority-4 (Low â€“ Future Wishlist):** Non-essential idea thatâ€™s not time-sensitive. May be exploratory or future-facing. Logged for future planning when capacity allows.
